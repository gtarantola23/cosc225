                <h3>Swimming Time Predictor</h3>
                <p>My goal is to use the historical times of a specific swimmer to predict their future performances.
                    Machine learning can help achieve this goal by analyzing a swimmer's performance over time to
                    determine whether they are dropping time or adding time and using these patterns to predict future
                    performance. So, Machine learning algorithms can help identify a relationship between past times and
                    future improvements based on time series data. I obtained my data from USAswimming.com, and got
                    historical statistics of two prominent swimmers.

                    This project looks at various regression models, and compares them in regards to accuracy and time.
                    Regresssion models will allow me to have a training and testing set while predicting a continuous
                    variable. It will be able to look at my data and see if there is a relationship. If linear
                    regression does not work very well, I will try random forest regression because the averaging of
                    many decision trees may cause more accurate predictions by reducing the variation in results.

                    Generally, I would look for a mean square error that corresponds to 3 seconds, some math will be
                    needed to calculate what is equivalent to three seconds after standardization. This cutoff was
                    determined by the relative amount of time this corresponds to in swimming. A 3-second difference in
                    any swimming event is a considerable difference in time/placement. That said, I believe it is a
                    reasonable cutoff, as predicting a time within 3 seconds is a generally good estimate. </p>
