      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p> Hi! My name is Grace Tarantola, and I am from Mountain Lakes, NJ. I am a senior <strong><em> computer science
            and chemistry </em></strong> double major here at Amherst College</p>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>I lived in Verona, NJ until I was about 3 years old, and then my family moved to Mountain Lakes, NJ. Here is
        some
        more about me:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I have a twin sister, and two step siblings
          <ul>
            <li>My twin is a senior chemistry and computer science major at Middlebury College</li>
            <li>My step sister is a freshman pre-med student at University of New Hampshire</li>
            <li>My step brother is a junior archeology major at Colgate College</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>I have four big dogs named: Ollie, Wyatt, Fiona and Phoebe, and they are all <strong>100</strong> lbs!</li>
        <li>I graduated Mountain Lakes High school in 2019, and immediately attended Amherst College.</li>
        <li>I am currently writing a chemistry thesis in the Durr Lab. It aims to create novel group V metal catalysts
          to
          aid in the ring opening polymerization of cyclic esters! I get to run my own experiments, read relevant
          research
          papers, and analyze all my data using various computer programs. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Extracirriculars</h2>
      <p>I am involved in <em>many</em> extracirriculars here on campus:</p>

        <li>I am on the executive board for Council of Amherst College Student Athletes of Color
          (<strong>CACSAC</strong>)</li>
        <li>I curate intriguing posts for the CACSAC and swim social media accounts. </li>
        <li>I served as the president of the women in computer science club for one year.</li>
        <li>I am a peer tutor in COSC-111 and COSC-112.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Fun facts</h2>
